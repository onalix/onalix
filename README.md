Welcome to my public GitHub profile. 


My name is Ramon N. Rayas. I'm a Machine Learning engineer.

I keep a record of my technical notes in my statically generated blog. Every blog post has a *Suggest changes* link right below the title that points to the markdown file used to generate the hypertext file. If you find any errors in my notes, feel free to open a pull request in the linked repository.

My home repository contains all my dotfiles; I'm a Neovim nerd, obsessed with the terminal. I do all of my AI/ML work inside the terminal, from prototyping to production.

Here's a link to my [personal blog][onalix] and [Youtube channel][youtube].
